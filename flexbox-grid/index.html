                  I was born in Dallas, Texas. Both of my parents are African. I lived there for 2 years to really come in contact with my roots. It was a life-changing experience and it taught me not to take things for granted. </p>

                  My Passion: I absolutely LOVE traveling. I've been to so many beautiful places around the world. I love learning new cultures and eating new foods while also getting to meet amazing new people! </p>

                  Fun Fact: I actually NEVER learned how to ride a bicyle! My brothers self-taught themselves how to ride bikes when we were all kids and I would always see them fall of the bikes and hurt themselves while learning and it made me not want to learn myself because I was scared of falling off and hurting myself. Maybe one day I'll learn though!</p>
